## Final Year project: GPU accelerated application for sentiment analysis based on Twitter Archive data.
This project aims to design and implement a fast and straight forward application for non-technical users to use for analysis of the Twitter data. The result is an application incorporating Sentiment Analysis, Data Preparation (ranging from Twitter API stream to Archive.org Twitter archives) and Data Visualisation. Final grade for the report on the project (52 pages + 20 appendix) was 86%.

### Bot Engine
Very old code with some terrible stuff going on. Nonetheless still cool in some ways. 
It supports multiple actions, such as:
* Finding monsters in nearest proximity and engaging in action
* Deposit, withdrawal, buying selling
* Auto disengage upon low health and automatic healing
* Ability to user define actions for sequential execution.
